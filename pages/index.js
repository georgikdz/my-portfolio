His international background helps him navigate the nuances of both U.S. and European business cultures.

When I'm not working, you'll find me training for my next marathon. I'm pursuing the Abbott World Marathon Majors—a series of the world's 7 most prestigious marathons. So far, I've completed 3/7: Chicago (2019), Berlin (2021), and New York City (2022), plus six other marathons along the way. Still to come: Sydney, Tokyo, Boston, and London.
